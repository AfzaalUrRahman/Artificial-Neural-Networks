**McCulloch-Pitts Model of Neurons:** Gain insights into the foundational model of neurons, which laid the groundwork for modern artificial neural networks.

**Perceptron:** Understand the workings of the perceptron, a fundamental building block of neural networks, and learn how it can be used for binary classification tasks.

**Feed Forward Neural Networks:** Explore the architecture and functionality of feedforward neural networks, which are capable of learning complex mappings between inputs and outputs.

**Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs):** Dive into MLPs, which consist of multiple layers of interconnected neurons and are widely used for a variety of tasks, including classification and regression.

**Optimization Algorithms:** Learn about a range of algorithms used to optimize the loss functions of neural networks, including gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and variants such as Adam and RMSprop.

**Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning:** Understand how ANNs can be used for different types of learning paradigms, including supervised learning with labeled data, unsupervised learning for discovering hidden patterns, and reinforcement learning for training agents to interact with environments.

**Advanced Topics:** Explore advanced concepts and architectures in the realm of ANNs, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoders (AEs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and more.

By the end of this course, students will have gained a solid understanding of artificial neural networks and their applications across various domains. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to tackle real-world problems using ANNs.
